 <p>You can execute the program from your environment of preference. </p>
<hr>

<ul>
    <li> I count only words, not punctuation </li>
    <li>I use Jaccard Index to compare the files</li>
    <li>I use list and sets as data structures</li>
</ul>

<h4> Jaccard Index</h4>
<p>
    Count the number of members which are shared between both sets.
    Count the total number of members in both sets.
    Divide the number of shared members by the total number of members.
    Multiply the number you found in by 100.
    This percentage tells you how similar the two sets are.
    
    Two sets that share all members would be 100% similar. The closer to 100%, the more similarity.
    If they share no members, they are 0% similar.
    The midway point — 50% — means that the two sets share half of the members.
